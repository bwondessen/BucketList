## Overview
This is a map app that allows you to create annotations on a map that represents the places you want to visist. 

To start, move the map to a desired location so that the blue circle in the center of the screen is pointing at it, then tap on the plus icon button in the bottom right corner of the screen. This will place an annotation marker of a red star on the map. Tap on the newly created annotation marker to enter place details, such as place and name. Here, you will be shown a list of nearby locations to help give you ideas.
